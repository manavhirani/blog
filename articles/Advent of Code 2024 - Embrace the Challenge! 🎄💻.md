## **Tips for Success**

### 1. **Start Simple**

Use your strongest language to complete the first few puzzles quickly. This will help you get a feel for the challenges and save the experimentation for later.

### 2. **Optimize Later**

Focus on getting a working solution first. Many puzzles have large input sizes or extra parts that reward optimization‚Äîbut don‚Äôt stress about perfection initially.

### 3. **Read the Problem Carefully**

AoC puzzles are often full of twists. Pay attention to edge cases and small details in the problem description.

### 4. **Collaborate with the Community**

- Join discussions on platforms like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) or AoC Discord servers.
- Share your progress and solutions for feedback.

### 5. **Automate and Reuse Code**

For recurring tasks (e.g., parsing input or creating grids), write reusable utility functions. These will save time as the puzzles get more complex.
