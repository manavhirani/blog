# Introduction to JAX: Accelerated Computing and Machine Learning Made Easy

JAX is a powerful and flexible library for numerical computing and machine learning, combining the expressiveness of NumPy with GPU/TPU acceleration. It is particularly popular in the research community for its ability to seamlessly scale computations from CPUs to GPUs and TPUs while enabling advanced techniques like automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation.

## Key Features of JAX

### 1. NumPy-like API

JAX’s interface is designed to be familiar to NumPy users. It provides a nearly drop-in replacement, allowing developers to leverage their existing NumPy knowledge while gaining access to powerful hardware acceleration.

python

Copy code

`import jax.numpy as jnp  # Example: Element-wise operations x = jnp.array([1, 2, 3]) y = jnp.array([4, 5, 6]) z = x + y  # [5, 7, 9]`

### 2. Automatic Differentiation

JAX’s `grad` function enables automatic differentiation, making it an excellent tool for optimization tasks and neural network training.

python

Copy code

`from jax import grad  # Define a simple function def f(x):     return x**2 + 3 * x + 2  # Compute its gradient df_dx = grad(f) print(df_dx(2.0))  # Output: 7.0`

### 3. Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation

JAX optimizes performance by compiling code to run efficiently on CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs using the `jit` decorator.

python

Copy code

`from jax import jit  @jit def compute_sum(x, y):     return jnp.dot(x, y)  x = jnp.ones((1000,)) y = jnp.ones((1000,)) result = compute_sum(x, y)  # Compiled to optimized machine code`

### 4. Parallelism and Vectorization

JAX provides primitives like `vmap` and `pmap` for vectorizing operations and running computations in parallel.

python

Copy code

`from jax import vmap  # Vectorize a function def square(x):     return x**2  v_square = vmap(square) print(v_square(jnp.array([1, 2, 3])))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]`

## Getting Started

Install JAX using pip:

bash

Copy code

`pip install jax jaxlib`

Ensure you have the right accelerator backend (e.g., CUDA or TPU support) if using GPUs or TPUs. Refer to the [official installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for more details.
