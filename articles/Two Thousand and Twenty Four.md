2024

This number is stable to me in my weird understanding and liking of numbers, it's even, it is made up of only powers of 2, except 0 of course unless you're looking at 2^(-inf).

Beyond this it indicated something deeper, wait no not really, it's mostly a number.

What value do numbers hold in this day and age? Well to begin with, day and age are usually defined by numbers, it is November 2024, that's how I know the age of today. It's 2024 years after a certain events. Wait years? Well a year is 365 days, or a revolution around the sun more or less, the stars haven't always looked the same in the night sky but you can safely assume most of the night sky has been the way it is for the last 1 million years as most stars have a lifespan of far beyond that. 

It is weird how a lot of humanity is dictated by our past, we are a species that self analyses. We're as if a neural network being trained over a billion years. To some, that is exactly what we are, one large reinforcement learning network.

If our consciousness is emergent, well so is this very thought, very blog and very existence the author and reader. Emergence is emergent in a way. This brings to mind many questions but while I'm on such thoughts I submit to non linguistic, non informational communication. Beyond context a mechanism of consciousness is at play that uses context and information to build understanding and experiences. In a naive gush of thought I move to language models encoding memory in their synapses, a weird mathematical duality which in some senses is constantly being pushed off equilibrium. Well what is the equilibrium state then?
