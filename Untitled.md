# Content  
- Header  
- The hyperlinks are not clickable on my end  
- Education  
- Change "Bachelor of Computer Science" to "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science" to make it more ATS friendly  
- Skills  
- Separate them using commas for being more ATS friendly  
- "Tool & Frameworks" => "Tools & Frameworks"  
- "Visualization tools" => "Visualization Tools"  
- For NLP and DL, I would suggest an addition of some more skills from the NLP stack like LangChains, LLaMaIndex, Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, RAG, GANs, FAISS, HuggingFace, Word2Vec, Flask, FastAPI and many many more...  
- Experience  
- Split every experience to be in 4 bullet points, in STAR method  
- Avoid repeating the usage of action words, e.g. "Designed" starts off 4 points, instead use words like "Formulated", "Facilitated", "Orchestrated", "Engineered" etc.  
- Keep it to one sentence per bullet point  
- Two experiences use "Skillset" and the others use "Skills"  
- Projects  
- Keep roughly 2 - 3 projects that stand out  
- Any research project that was presented could go into a new section called "Research Publications & Presentations", it helps you stand out for AI/ML roles  
# Structure & Design  
- Header  
- Looks clean and easy to read  
- Education  
- The degrees look misaligned, hyphenation and spacing is inconsistent  
- Skills  
- Looks off from the entire document  
- Experience  
- Last experience is indented ahead of the others  
- Projects  
- Alignment of the first heading is off  
# General Insights  
- Multiple grammatical mistakes, inconsistent paragraph and text alignment across sections  
- Content quality is great for NLP and DL roles  
- Try to keep the latest experience to be more aligned to the roles you are targeting  
- Other than this, it looks presentable  
# Suggestions  
- The resume reflects your skills and competencies very well, especially for Gen AI dev roles  
- Since the market is super competitive, small improvements and fixes can help you stand out  
- I used [Reactive Resume - A free and open-source resume builder]([https://rxresu.me/)](https://rxresu.me/\)) to help take care of the design side of things  
- Since you have roughly 4 experiences, feel free to exceed the page limit instead of keeping it to just 1  
- Add sections for Leadership & Research  
- Leadership could have any Assistantships/Volunteering which is still aligned to the role for soft skills, e.g. TA for an NLP class  
- I would rearrange the experience to be at the top and skills at the bottom  
- For ATS friendliness, repeat key skills throughout the sections  
- Tailor the resume for specific job applications by emphasizing relevant skills and experiences (This I can explain over a call to automate using LLMs)  
- Some people add a brief summary at the top which can be helpful  
- Include relevant soft skills such as teamwork, communication, or problem-solving throughout  
- After every update to the resume proofread for typos and grammatical errors to maintain professionalism
